Hello World

\char`\"{}\+Hello World\char`\"{} is traditionally the first program one writes in a new language.


\begin{DoxyVerbInclude}
#!/usr/bin/env bill

# hello.bill
# aka hello world

fun main():no_value
{
    writeln("Hello World")
    exit                    // defaults to 0
}

\end{DoxyVerbInclude}
 hello.\+bill

Of course, the first few lines are unnecessary. However, declaring a main function is required. Details, on that, in the next shapter (\mbox{\hyperlink{Functions}{Functions}}).
