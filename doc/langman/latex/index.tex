\mbox{\hyperlink{}{Hello World }}

~~~~~~~ \char`\"{}\+Hello World\char`\"{} is traditionally the first program one writes in a new language. That makes it a good starting point.


\begin{DoxyVerbInclude}
#!/usr/bin/env bill

# hello.bill
# aka hello world

fun main():no_value
{
    writeln("Hello World")
    exit                    // defaults to 0
}

\end{DoxyVerbInclude}
 hello.\+bill

~~~~~~~ Of course, the first few lines are unnecessary. However, declaring a main function is required. For details, on that, in shapter 6 (\mbox{\hyperlink{Functions}{Functions}}).

To compile and run\+:


\begin{DoxyVerbInclude}
prompt> bill hello.bill
\end{DoxyVerbInclude}


If you operating system supports shebangs, the following will work\+:


\begin{DoxyVerbInclude}
prompt> hello.bill
\end{DoxyVerbInclude}

exit &end program (possible exit value) &See below.  \\\cline{1-3}

try &begin try block &See \mbox{\hyperlink{Exceptions}{Exceptions}}   \\\cline{1-3}
\end{longtabu}
With exit, you can use any positive int64 value. However, 0 (default) generally represents a good run. Typically, a problem is designated by 1.
