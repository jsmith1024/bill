\mbox{\hyperlink{}{Hello World }}

~~~~~~~ \char`\"{}\+Hello World\char`\"{} is traditionally the first program one writes in a new language. That makes it a good starting point.


\begin{DoxyVerbInclude}
#!/usr/bin/env bill

# hello.bill
# aka hello world

fun main():no_value
{
    writeln("Hello World")
    exit                    // defaults to 0
}

\end{DoxyVerbInclude}
 hello.\+bill

~~~~~~~ Of course, the first few lines are unnecessary. However, declaring a main function is required. For details, on that, in shapter 6 (\mbox{\hyperlink{Functions}{Functions}}).

To compile and run\+:


\begin{DoxyVerbInclude}
prompt> bill hello.bill
\end{DoxyVerbInclude}


If you operating system supports shebangs, the following will work\+:


\begin{DoxyVerbInclude}
prompt> hello.bill
\end{DoxyVerbInclude}
\hypertarget{index_Reserved}{}\doxysection{Reserved Words}\label{index_Reserved}
Here is a list of Reserved Words\+: \tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu}spread 0pt [c]{*{2}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
break &exit loop{$\ast$}  \\\cline{1-2}
continue &skip to next iteration{$\ast$}  \\\cline{1-2}
else &default condition{$\ast$}  \\\cline{1-2}
elsif &subsequent condition{$\ast$}  \\\cline{1-2}
exit &end program (possible exit value)  \\\cline{1-2}
if &condition{$\ast$}  \\\cline{1-2}
return &end a function (possible return value){$\ast$}{$\ast$}  \\\cline{1-2}
try &begin try block{$\ast$}{$\ast$}{$\ast$}  \\\cline{1-2}
\end{longtabu}
With exit, you can use any positive int64 value. However, 0 (default) generally represents a good run. Typically, a problem is designated by 1. However other values are possible.

{$\ast$}~~~~~~ See \mbox{\hyperlink{Flow}{Flow Control}}.
