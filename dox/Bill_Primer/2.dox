Every form of data is a type. By extension, the same is true for functions.
Built in types:
- null
- boolean
- int8
- int64
- float64
- string
- array
- vector
- set
- tuple
- dictionary

@section    Integers
All integers are signed. See @ref Unsigned for more information.

There are two integer types:
- int8 is 8 bit. (-128 to + 127)
- int64 is 64 bit. (Â± a really big number)

<i>Tip:</i> Only use int8 for space conserving situations,
provided all values will always fall within limits.
Else, use int64. Don't trust "Ther's no reason for it to go beyond limits."
It must be <b>impossible</b> to exceed limits or, it's only a matter of time. 

@subsection Unsigned

Why no unsigned integers? Here is a great answer:
